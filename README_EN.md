# ILCE7M3ExternalGps

An external GPS module for Sony ILCE-7M3 that is based on ESP32 and generic GPS module (hardware model is undetermined yet) to substitute for the Imaging Edge Mobile app. Works by emulating reverse engineered BLE location transmission protocol.

~~The completion of this project CANNOT be guaranteed for now.~~ Due to personal capacity reasons, this project has been abandoned. The uploaded code was finished in 2021 and is for reference only. It seems to work but it's really really trashy code. The hardware board design is way too bad with multiple issues so I'm not even gonna release it. Feel free to do whatever you want with the current content (note that the TinyGPSPlus library used is under LGPL license, I'm not adding a LICENSE file here to this repo).
